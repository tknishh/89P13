    "### Relationship Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-to-one:** A one-to-one relationship is a relationship where a single instance of one entity is related to a single instance of another entity. For example, a single customer can have one account.\n",
    "- **One-to-many:** A one-to-many relationship is a relationship where a single instance of one entity is related to multiple instances of another entity. For example, a single customer can have multiple orders.\n",
    "- **Many-to-many:** A many-to-many relationship is a relationship where multiple instances of one entity are related to multiple instances of another entity. For example, multiple customers can place an order for the same product.\n",
    "- **Supertype-subtype:** A supertype-subtype relationship is a relationship where a general entity (supertype) is related to specific entities (subtypes). For example, an Employee entity could be a supertype to entities for Full-Time Employees and Part-Time Employees.\n",
    "- **Recursive relationship:** A recursive relationship is a relationship where an entity is related to itself. For example, a manager-employee relationship, where an employee can also be a manager of other employees.\n",
    "- **Association relationship:** An association relationship is a relationship that describes the relationship between two entities without explicit cardinality."

    "### Data Model keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary key:** A primary key is a unique identifier for a record within a table. It must be ***unique*** for each record and ***cannot be null***. For example, a customer table might have a primary key of “customer_id”, where each customer is assigned a unique ID.\n",
    "- **Foreign key:** A foreign key is a field in a table that ***refers to the primary key of another table***. It is used to establish a link between two tables and to ensure ***referential integrity***. For example, an order table might have a foreign key of “customer_id” that references the primary key of the customer table.\n",
    "- **Alternate key:** An alternate key is a ***unique identifier*** for a record within a table that can be used as an ***alternative to the primary key***. It is used when there are multiple unique identifiers for a record. For example, a product table might have an alternate key of “product_code” in addition to the primary key “product_id”.\n",
    "- **Surrogate key:** A surrogate key is a ***unique identifier*** for a record within a table that is ***not related to the natural attributes of the data***. It is used when there is no natural primary key. For example, an Employee table might have a surrogate key “Employee_number”, which is a unique identifier assigned to each employee."

    "\n",
    "- **First Normal Form (1NF):** This is the most basic level of normalization. It requires that *each table has a primary key* and that all data is ***atomic***, meaning that *each column contains only one value* and that there are no repeating groups of data.\n",
    "- **Second Normal Form (2NF):** In addition to meeting the requirements of 1NF, a table in 2NF must *not have any partial dependencies*. A **partial dependency** is when a non-primary key column depends on only part of the primary key.\n",
    "- **Third Normal Form (3NF):** In addition to meeting the requirements of 2NF, a table in 3NF must *not have any transitive dependencies*. A **transitive dependency** is when a non-primary key column depends on another non-primary key column.\n",
    "- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):** This is a higher level of normalization than 3NF. In addition to meeting the requirements of 3NF, a table in BCNF must not have any non-trivial functional dependencies. A **non-trivial functional dependency** is when a non-primary key column depends on the entire primary key.\n",
    "- **Fourth Normal Form (4NF) and Fifth Normal Form (5NF)** also exist but are not widely used."

    "**Cascading actions** are the actions that happen when a user performs an action on a parent table that affects the data in related child tables. For example, when a user deletes a record from the parent table, the related records in the child table will also be deleted. This can be a problem if you want to keep the data in the child table, so you can use “restricted cascade” to prevent this cascading effect."
