    "A data warehouse is a central repository for data which will be used for reporting and analytics. A data warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics. Data warehouses are solely intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data."

    "## Why do we need data warehouses?\n",
    "\n",
    "- you need to retrieve data from many data sources (excel, databases, apis, etc)\n",
    "- creating a DW enables users to create report off of that, rather than having it done by working against operational system, cause it may bring performance issues.\n",
    "- have a single version of truth so that depts create results in complaint to other dept, maintain consistency.\n",
    "- can store historical data (a position when prev records are needed to be saved.)\n",
    "- need to keep historical records, even if source system doesn't.\n",
    "- users might miuse, or corrupt transaction data.\n",
    "- Optimized for read access which makes generating reports faster than using a source transaction system for reporting\n",
    "- focus is on **\"Single version of truth\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- A significant investment of time and resources to properly build\n",
    "- Not designed for ingesting data in real-time (although they can typically handle near real-time)"

    "- data arrives at staging area where some business logic is applied before moving it to data warehouse if deemed necessary.\n",
    "- DQS(Data Quality Services) are responsible to store various data quality checks and rules. Whereas MDS(Master data Services) is where core entites of master data is stored.\n",
    "- SSIS is SQL server intergration tool.\n",

    "### Modern-DW\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is maybe a combination of both an on-premise data warehouse and cloud data warehouse or only cloud data warehouse according to need. \n",
    "- Data is ingested from various sources into storage blob(azure data-stack) which stores all the data as file. It is like a data lake where as azure synapse is like data warehouse. These both are part of your data factory. "

    "- stands for Online Transaction Processing\n",
    "- it captures, stores, and process data from trnasactions in real-time\n",
    "- design to capture data quickly\n",
    "- it stores data in various tables for a given transaction like, updates data when a purchase is made. Updates order table, product table, customer table etc.\n",
    "- Used for day-to-day operation.\n",
    "- Application oriented.\n",
    "- It's usage is repetitve as it is current data, up-to-date, flat, relational and isolated.\n",
    "- read/write operations accessed.\n",
    "- unit of work is for short and simple transactions\n",

    "\n",
    "- stands for Online Analytical Processing\n",
    "- it uses complex queries to analyse aggregated historical data from OLTP systems\n",
    "- designed for creating reports.\n",
    "- data is stored in form of multiple cubes like a rubik cube where each block or smaller cube represent aggregated computation of certain dimensions. It may be like a small cube will represent total sales in month of Jan in 2023 for a product phone.\n",
    "- all the data is stored in this way, this is why it is super performant and quicker with queries.\n",
    "- helpful with decision support.\n",
    "- Subject oriented.\n",
    "- data is historical, summarized multi-dimensional, consolidated.\n",
    "- used only when a purpose is to be fulfilled, i.e. ad-hoc.\n",
    "- Requires a lots of scans, needs complex queries, data size is in TBs, metric for this is query throughput and response.\n",

    "#### Dimensions of a data could be understand like a particular product, sold at certain time and at certain location. So here, product, location and time are dimensions of the data."
