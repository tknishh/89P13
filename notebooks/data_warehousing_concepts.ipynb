    "A data warehouse is a central repository for data which will be used for reporting and analytics. A data warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics. Data warehouses are solely intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data."

    "## Why do we need data warehouses?\n",
    "\n",
    "- you need to retrieve data from many data sources (excel, databases, apis, etc)\n",
    "- creating a DW enables users to create report off of that, rather than having it done by working against operational system, cause it may bring performance issues.\n",
    "- have a single version of truth so that depts create results in complaint to other dept, maintain consistency.\n",
    "- can store historical data (a position when prev records are needed to be saved.)\n",
    "- need to keep historical records, even if source system doesn't.\n",
    "- users might miuse, or corrupt transaction data.\n",
    "- Optimized for read access which makes generating reports faster than using a source transaction system for reporting\n",
    "- focus is on **\"Single version of truth\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- A significant investment of time and resources to properly build\n",
    "- Not designed for ingesting data in real-time (although they can typically handle near real-time)"

In SCD-II we'll add another record with new state and keep tabs of my start and end dates in a certain state for query purpose. In SCD-III we keep 2 columns one with original state/Prev State and another with current. But it'll be limited to 2 historical values only in this case."
